# C---Inverse-matrix-solve-3x3-system-equations
a small program developed with C to solve a 3x3 system of equations using the inverse matrix method

all this program needs to begin the operations is the entry data from the user.. so he has to fill a 3x3 matrix and this will be followed by a somewate detailed explanation of how we did obtain such a result.
this means it will show you the delta of the initial matrix, then the cofactors of each column, after that the cofactors of the inverse matrix and lastly the program displays the invers matrix in 2 formas, fractions or decimal values
